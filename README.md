## Using `rclone` to access to cloud files

Large files may have been moved to a OneDrive folder due to space limitations. You can find them in the [shared folder](https://bocconi-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/samuele_straccialini_studbocconi_it/EjLdGCkSWehAq587J8KcJ9YBEsersXTvplLDyZ8OBpLDfA?e=PW31EI).

If you wish to have access to the shared folder, please follow the following passages:
- Copy the folder into your own OneDrive.
- Install `rclone` on your machine: https://rclone.org/install/
- Run `rclone config` in your terminal and connect it to your OneDrive.

**Note:** if you wish to use our code to read and write in the folder, kindly name the remote "`onedrive`" when running `rclone` configuration.
